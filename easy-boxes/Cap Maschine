# Hack The Box — Cap

## Overview
**Cap** is an easy-difficulty Hack The Box machine focused on **network traffic analysis**, **IDOR**, and **credential reuse**.  
The main objective is to analyze captured PCAP files, extract sensitive credentials, and leverage them to gain user and root access.

## Machine Information
- **Name:** Cap
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Category:** Network Analysis / Web / Credentials
- **Platform:** Hack The Box
- **Status:** Fully Pwned (User + Root)

---

## Enumeration

### Open TCP Ports : 3 

  
Identified via initial port scanning.

---

## Web Application Analysis

### Security Snapshot Function
After running a **Security Snapshot**, the browser redirects to the following path format: /data/{id}


This reveals an **IDOR vulnerability**, allowing access to other users’ scan results by modifying the ID.

---

## Exploitation

### PCAP File Analysis
- Sensitive data was found in **PCAP file with ID `0`**
- Traffic analysis revealed **cleartext FTP credentials**

**Application Layer Protocol Identified:**  FTP 

  
---

## Credential Reuse

Recovered FTP credentials belonged to user **nathan**.

The same password was successfully reused on: SSH

  
This granted direct user-level shell access.

---

## Privilege Escalation

- SSH access as `nathan`
- Standard enumeration led to root escalation
- Root flag successfully retrieved

---

## Flags

### User Flag

### Root Flag

## Key Takeaways
- IDOR vulnerabilities can expose sensitive internal data
- PCAP files often contain reusable credentials
- Credential reuse across services is a critical security flaw
- Network traffic analysis is a powerful attack vector
